%% WHAT is PDF/A
%%
%% PDF/A is the ISO-standardized version of the pdf. The standard's goal is to
%% ensure that he file is reproducable even after a long time. PDF/A differs
%% from pdf in that it allows only those pdf features that support long-term
%% archiving of a file. For example, PDF/A requires that all used fonts are
%% embedded in the file, whereas a normal pdf can contain only a link to the
%% fonts in the system of the reader of the file. PDF/A also requires, among
%% other things, data on colour definition and the encryption used.
%% Currently three PDF/A standards exist:
%% PDF/A-1: based on PDF 1.4, standard ISO19005-1, published in 2005.
%%          Includes all the requirements essential for long-term archiving.
%% PDF/A-2: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-2, published in 2011.
%%          In addition to the above, it supports embedding of OpenType fonts,
%%          transparency in the colour definition and digital signatures.
%% PDF/A-3: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-3, published in 2012.
%%          Differs from the above only in that it allows embedding of files in
%%          any format (e.g., xml, csv, cad, spreadsheet or wordprocessing
%%          formats) into the pdf file.
%% PDF/A-1 files are not necessarily PDF/A-2 -compatible and PDF/A-2 are not
%% necessarily PDF/A-1 -compatible.
%% All of the above PDF/A standards have two levels:
%% b: (basic) requires that the visual appearance of the document is reliably
%%    reproduceable.
%% a (accessible) in addition to the b-level requirements, specifies how
%%   accessible the pdf file is to assistive software, say, for the physically
%%   impaired.
%% For more details on PDF/A, see, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A
%%
%%
%% WHICH PDF/A standard should my thesis conform to?
%%
%% Primarily to the PDF/A-1b standard. All the figures and graphs typically
%% use in thesis work do not require transparency features, a basic '2-D'
%% visualisation suffices. The font to be used are specified in this template
%% and they should not be changed. However, if you have figures where
%% transparency characteristics matter, use the PDF/A-2b standard. Do not use
%% the PDF/A-3b standard for your thesis.
%%
%%
%% WHAT graphics format can I use to produce my PDF/A compliant file?
%%
%% When using pdflatex to compile your work, use jpg, png or pdf files. You may
%% have PDF/A compliance problems with figures in pdf format. Do not use PDF/A
%% compliant graphics files.
%% If you decide to use latex to compile your work, the only acceptable file
%% format for your figure is eps. DO NOT use the ps format for your figures.

%% USE one of these:
%% * the first when using pdflatex, which directly typesets your document in the
%%   chosen pdf/a format and you want to publish your thesis online,

%% * the second when you want to print your thesis to bind it, or
%% * the third when producing a ps file and a pdf/a from it.

\section{Introduction}

%% For the introduction I guess it can be mostly copied from the thesis proposal,
%% anyway one of the last sections to write.

\subsection{Contributions}

% Explain the contributions introduced in that thesis.

\subsection{Structure of the thesis}

% Easy section, it can be mostly written now.

%% Leave page number of the first page empty
\thispagestyle{empty}

\clearpage
\section{Background}

%% The objective of the background section is to give a business context to explain where the problem come from.

\subsection{Company description}

%% Describe Unity technologies as a company.
%% Describe Unity Acquire architecture.
%% Describe Unity Acquire Microservices architecture.
%% Describe Unity Services gateway and why it is needed.

\subsection{Problem definition}

%% Describe the problem from different angles, depending on the stakeholders involved.

%% - Public APIs team: Describe that from our side the requirements is having more
%%                     visibility in the term of the errors that are generating through
%%                     our API calls from the engineering part of view.

%% - Product management: Describe that from the product side, it is important to know the high
%%                       level errors as they are in contact with the client, and they have to 
%%                       contact them in case that they are doing some wrong integrations, for example
%%                       if they hit the rate limits.

%% - Security team: From their perspective it is important to set some visibility on the high level errors
%%                  in case that some individual malicious user is doing some kind of attack to the system.


\clearpage
\section{Requirement analysis}

%% Taking into consideration that everyone has clear who are the stakeholders and what is the structure of the
%% company and the microservices involved, now we have to do the requirement analysis.

%% We can list the project requirements like:

%% - We need to do a clear definition of the errors that we want to log.
%% - The logging technology has to support a lot of stress as we are having x (collect the number of average requests).
%% - The provided solution has to be cloud agnostic (this is why some part has to be implemented in Terraform or using an external service).
%% - We need a visual tool in order to communicate effectively with the stakeholders.

\subsection{Research questions}

%% Taking into consideration the previous requirement analysis we can state down the research questions.

\clearpage
\section{Literature review}

%% In this section is where all the technologies used are reviewed. For sure having the following subsections:

\subsection{Microservices architectures}

%% In this section we can include the following:
%% - Monolitical vs. microservices architectures. (drawbacks and advantages).
%% - Definition of Domain Oriented Microservices Architecture, stressing out that this is a problem that many 
%%   big companies are facing.

\subsection{Observability & Monitoring}

%% In this section we can differentiate the following topics:
%% - Observability and Monitoring definition.
%% - Application of observability and monitoring to microservices.
%% - Data observability.
%% - The four pillars of data observability (check one of the articles).

\subsection{Framework comparisons}

%% In this section a comparison of the current frameworks for monitoring and observability has to be done.
%% The following can be compared:

%% - Google custom monitoring & observability tools.
%% - Datadog
%% - Amplitude

%% It is important to explain the features of all of them when monitoring microservices, also taking into consideration
%% the costs analysis, and if they are suitable for showing the custom data that we are going to log.

\clearpage
\section{Technical solution}

%% The outcome of this thesis are basically 4 technical solutions.

\subsection{High level errors definitions}

%% In this section describe the different high level errors and the standard that we are defining for them.
%% Check out the ones defined previously by Uber gateway API.

\subsection{Error schema generator} %%% OPTIONAL

%% Possible Open Source tool used to generate gateway routes schema definitions using a CLI.
%% If implemented, describe it here.

\subsection{Proof of concept using error rate tool}

%% The things that need to be covered here are:

%% - Planning (Using AirTable and estimation)
%% - Implementation on the gateway side. Explain that Unity currently has a logging tool enabled and we only had to log certain events gathering the requests.
%% - Terraform implementation. This part is where it can be explained how we use terraform and how to the problem cloud-agnostic.
%% - BigQuery setup.

\subsection{Error visualization dashboard}

%% Cover here the grafana dashboard implementation tool

%% - Cover the usage of the Grafana + BigQuery tool.
%% - Describe the different panels that had been developed.
%% - Persistance of the dashboard and deployment on every build.

\section{Evaluation}

%% The evaluation needs to be done for each of the artifacts separated:

\subsection{Evaluation of the error schema generator} 

%% Add the testing here if implemented.

\subsection{Evaluation of the proof of concept}

%% Here we can say two evaluation methods:
%% - Test script in order to inject mock data and see if it is storing correctly the data.
%% - Integration tests using jest on the gateway side.
%% - Using Proof of concept in order to test how the database was doing.
%% - Using staging and production in order to have different sources for the data.

\subsection{Evaluation of the visualization tool}

%% For the evaluation of the visualization tool we can explain the following:
%% - Using mock data in order to iterate over the dashboards.
%% - Using continuos reviews from the stakeholders. mention the API team and the gateway team.

\section{Conclusions}

%% This part is almost the last one to write, basically write some pages of conclussions, and offer future work

%% For future work basically it can be checked if there is something on the backlog.
